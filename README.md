# docker-erlang-windows

Windows containers with Erlang pre-installed.  Experimental.

## Usage

Head over to this repos published [packages](https://github.com/orgs/avid-technology/packages/container/package/erlang) and pick a flavour.

## Known issues

* Images based on `windows/nanoserver` are _really_ experimental as in they don't work.  Our assumption is that there are some missing dependencies in the image that need to be included as part of the build process.  PRs welcome.
